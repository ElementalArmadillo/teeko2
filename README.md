# teeko2

This a slightly modified version of the 2 player game teeko. This program is an AI for a teeko player.

# Rules:

This is a simple turn based game on a 5x5 board. Each player is assigned a color red or black. There are 2 phases to the game:
In the drop phase, each player places a piece on the board, until there are 8 pieces on the board.
In the move phase, players move one of their pieces one space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This continues until one player reaches a win condition.
The win conditions are: 4 pieces in a row in any direction, or pieces on 4 corners of a 3x3 square with the center being empty.
